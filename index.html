      <h2>❤️ When I Come to Allah Walking, He Comes to Me Running</h2>
      <div class="love-content">
        <p>There is a love that does not wane, a love that does not depend on seasons or circumstance. It is not bound by time, nor is it shaped by the fleeting desires of the world. It is the love I carry in my heart for Allah, a love that deepens with every breath, every whispered prayer, every moment of stillness beneath the vast sky He has created.</p>
        <p>I find Him in the hush of dawn, when the world still sleeps and only the birds know the secret of waking with His name. I find Him in the verses of the Quran, where every word feels like a light placed gently in my hands. I find Him in my hardships, when pain carves through my soul, yet His mercy fills the cracks before they can break me.</p>
        <p>Loving Allah is a way of being. It is surrendering my fears to Him, knowing He is Al-Wadud—the Most Loving. It is trusting that every unanswered prayer is a blessing in disguise, that every trial is a step closer to Him. It is seeing His signs in everything: in the way the ocean never swallows the shore, in the way the stars refuse to dim, in the way my heart beats without my command.</p>
        <p>My love for Allah is the certainty that He has never left me, not for a single moment. It is the knowledge that no matter how lost I may feel, I am never truly lost—because I am always in His hands.</p>

      <h2>Be the Answer to Someone's Prayers</h2>
      <div class="launchgood-content">
        <p>Give today, not for recognition, but for an eternal reward. Even the smallest act of charity can plant seeds of goodness that outlive us. Visit <a href="https://launchgood.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LaunchGood.com</a> and be part of something that will continue to benefit others long after we’re gone. May Allah bless and multiply your giving. Ameen.</p>
        <p>My love for Allah and His love for me is the most beautiful thing I've ever known. There is no love like the love of Allah. The world teaches us to chase, to run after things that slip through our fingers like sand. But love for Allah teaches surrender—the kind that is not weakness, but strength, the kind that quiets the storms within.</p>
        <p>When I love Allah, I let go of the illusion of control. I accept that His wisdom far surpasses mine, that every unanswered prayer is a hidden mercy, that every trial is a step closer to Him. There were times I begged for what I thought I needed, only to later thank Him for withholding it. It is through loving Allah that I have learned: what is meant for me will never miss me, and what misses me was never meant for me.</p>
        <p>His love is not like human love. It does not come and go. It does not depend on perfection. It does not ask for beauty or wealth or status. It asks only for a heart that turns to Him, no matter how many times it has strayed. Everything in this life is temporary. The people we cherish will one day leave, the things we own will one day vanish. But Allah remains. His love is eternal, and to love Him is to hold onto something that can never be taken away.</p>
        <p>I often think about the moment I will stand before Him, the moment when my life will be laid bare, when every prayer, every tear, every whispered longing will be known to Him. I pray that on that day, He will know me as someone who loved Him, not just in words, but in every breath, in every action, in every part of my being. Every act of worship is a love letter to Allah.</p>
        <p>LaunchGood reminds me that I don’t need to be wealthy to make a difference. Giving even a little, alongside daily dhikr like Alhamdulillah (All praise is due to Allah), SubhanAllah (Glory be to Allah), Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Greatest), and Astaghfirullah (I seek forgiveness from Allah), fills my life with blessings. And with platforms like this, investing in the akhirah has never been easier.</p>
        <p>May Allah reward all those who created and contribute to LaunchGood, and may He continue to humble and elevate us in this dunya and the Hereafter. Ameen.</p>
        <p><strong>Sadaqah Jariyah</strong> translates to "continuous charity" or "ongoing charity" in English. It refers to acts of giving that continue to benefit others long after they are given, bringing ongoing rewards to the giver even after their passing.</p>
        <p>I have always believed that whatever I give for the sake of Allah never truly leaves my hands—it only multiplies in ways I may never fully see. From the smallest gesture, like offering a smile, to acts of kindness toward animals and strangers, to donating even a single piso, I have witnessed the power of sadaqah jariyah in my life.</p>
        <blockquote>“The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a seed of grain that sprouts seven ears, and in each ear is a hundred grains. And Allah multiplies for whom He wills. And Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing.” (Quran 2:261)</blockquote>
        <p>I have pledged contributions—no matter how small—to invest in my hereafter, to purify my life in this dunya, and to seek Allah’s pleasure alone. Whether helping the less fortunate in Metro Manila or using technology to extend my reach beyond borders, I know that every act of charity carries an everlasting reward.</p>
        <p><strong>Rizq</strong> is not just money. It is peace, it is health, it is barakah in time and sustenance. I have seen how sadaqah opens unseen doors, how it shields me from hardships, how it transforms my life in ways I never expected. The Prophet ﷺ said, “Charity does not decrease wealth.” (Muslim 2588) And I have found this to be true.</p>
        <p>This is why I give. Not for recognition, not for praise, but because I want to leave behind something that will outlive me. A ripple of kindness, a legacy of giving. So that long after I am gone, my sadaqah jariyah continues to speak for me. And I hope others will follow, so that together, we build a future filled with mercy and light.</p>
        <p>In a world where giving has never been easier, LaunchGood has become a gateway to endless blessings. Whether it's funding water wells, supporting orphans, or empowering education, every campaign is a chance to invest in eternity.</p>
        <p>The Prophet Musa ❤️س said: رِبِّ إِنِي لِمَا أَنْزَلْتَ إِلَيَّ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَقيْرٌ Rabbi inni lima anzalta ilayya min khayrin faqir ("‎My Lord, indeed I am in need of whatever good You send down to me.") (Quran 28:24)</p>
        <p>May Allah continue to guide us to paths of generosity and love. May our hands always be open to give, and our hearts always open to gratitude. May He humble us in kindness and elevate us in His mercy, in this life and the next. Ameen.</p>
        <p><strong>What you give today will be waiting for you in the Hereafter.</strong> Even the smallest sadaqah can change a life and bring endless barakah. Don’t wait—be a part of something eternal. Give now at <a href="https://launchgood.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LaunchGood.com</a> and let your charity be a source of mercy for you. May Allah accept and multiply your giving. Ameen.</p>
